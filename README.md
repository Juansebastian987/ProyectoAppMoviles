# Proyecto App Moviles

This project was made for the Mobile Applications class.

Today, our society is going through different social changes, things that 30 years ago were inconceivable or badly seen, today they are normalizing, new trends are appearing, and among those trends is the one that this project aims to exploit: the tendency of people to prefer pets to children. That's right, since the 90's there has been a constant growth in the number of people who adopt or buy pets, while the birth rates have been reduced; from these trends the so-called "petmoms" have been born, women who prefer to have pets over children. 
But just as we have seen an increase in the number of people adopting pets, so too has the work responsibility experienced by certain people, as they must increasingly devote themselves to the projects assigned to them, or must undertake business trips that can cause them to spend weeks away from home. And what happens when one of these people has a four-legged member? Well, they come up with two solutions:

Leave him alone with enough food and water to survive the time he's away. This is not a very viable solution, because it could be that the trip will take a little longer than expected and the child's food will run out long before he returns. Besides, the child does not receive enough attention, for example, in the case of dogs, they need to be taken for walks in order to maintain a good mood and to exercise.

Leave it in the care of someone close, and although it is the best strategy for these cases, what happens if the person with whom you plan to leave your friend is not someone who is dedicated entirely to the care of the animal, but has other responsibilities, and can not provide the attention that the animal requires? 

That is why this initiative is born, an application dedicated entirely to the care of your friend in any circumstance, the user can be completely sure that your beloved pet is always being attended by a person whose only task is to make your pet is always happy and in his best shape.
